# kali-utils

A collection of small, purpose-built terminal utilities for my Kali Linux CTF setup.

Tools are minimal, fast, and written for my own workflow. Each lives in its own folder with a `README.md`.

## Available

- `aliasman` â€” terminal alias manager with syntax highlighting and edit/search support

More coming as I build them out.
